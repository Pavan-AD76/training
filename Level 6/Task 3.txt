Topic: Population vs. Sample

Scenario: A researcher studies the average income of families in a city by surveying 100 households.

Solution:
	Population: All families in the city.

	Sample: The 100 surveyed households.

In this case, the researcher is interested in understanding the income of all families in the city (the population) but collects data from only a subset (the sample) due to practical constraints.

Topic: Sampling Techniques

Scenario: Survey employee satisfaction in a company with departments of varying sizes.

Selected Technique: Stratified Sampling  

Justification: Stratified sampling is the best choice because the company has departments of varying sizes.
               By dividing employees into strata (departments) and then selecting a proportional sample from 
               each, we ensure that all departments are adequately represented. This method prevents overrepresentation 
               of larger departments and underrepresentation of smaller ones, leading to more accurate and reliable survey results.

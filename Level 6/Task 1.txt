Topic: Types of Statistics

Types of Statistics:
    1. Descriptive - It consists of organizing and sumarizing data
    2. Inferential - It is a technique where we use the data that we have measured, to form conclusions.

Difference between inferential and descriptive statistics:
    
    Descriptive:
        i) Describe the features of populations and/or samples
        ii) Organize and present data in a purely factual way
        iii) Present final results visually, using tables, charts, or graphs
        iv) Draw conclusions based on known data
        v) Use measures like central tendency, distribution, and variance

        Example:
            A pie chart displaying the different hair colors in the population, clearly showing that brown hair is the most common.

    Inferential statistics:
        i) Use samples to make generalizations about larger populations
        ii) Help us to make estimates and predict future outcomes
        iii) Present final results in the form of probabilities
        iv) Draw conclusions that go beyond the available data
        v) Use techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression and correlation analysis

        Example:
            This would be analyzing the hair color of one college class of students and using that result to predict the most popular hair color in the entire college.
